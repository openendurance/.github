# Open Endurance Initiative
The Open Endurance Initiative was created to foster open innovation, collaboration, and equity in endurance sports.

## History

The motivation to create FKT was born from the idea to open source [Group Run Finder](https://grouprunfinder.com) and the dataset that powers it‚Äìwork that is currently in progress‚Äìto better align development of that product with the overarching goal of fostering community and inclusion in running. The code that is being migrated to the core codebase is largely what powers GRF today, and the objective is to expand on that core functionality to enable developers to more quickly build commercial-grade applications that serve the larger endurance sports ecosystem.

We're still early on in this process and this is very much work-in-progress, but the genuine hope is that of building a long-lasting platform that can be used to encourage innovation, transparency, and equity in our respective sports. For more info on OEI's goals, please visit [openendurance.org](https://openendurance.org) (ahem, we sure could use some help building building that site out, j/s).

Interesting in helping shape the future of open source endurance sports? Jump in and give us a hand (see _Contribute to OEI_, below) or [drop us a line](mailto:team@openendurance.org) with your ideas, thoughts, or other feedback.

## Contribute to OEI

OEI is just getting started, and we need your help! Here's what we're looking for:

-  Maintainers to help with various projects
-  Developers
-  Devops engineers
-  Graphic designers and UX folks
-  Writers to help with documentation and requirements
-  Writers to help with marketing copy and web content
-  Social media marketers to help with, well, social media marketing

Note that we're building an ecosystem of tools, so your time might be best spent on one of our other projects. For example, we need UI/UX help building out our design system. For a look at everything we're working on, check out the [OEI organization page](https://github.com/openendurance).

If you're interests lie outside something that can be accomplished through github‚Äìsocial media, for example, [email us](mailto:team@openendurance.org) to talk about how we might best collaborate.
